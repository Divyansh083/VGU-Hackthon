          The most important aspect in agricultural process is to loosen the
          topsoil. The loosened soil helps in the growth of earthworm and soil
          microbes. These organisms add humus to the soil and are friendly to
          farmers. Plants absorb water, minerals, nutrients and air from the
          soil through their roots. Hence it is essential to prepare the soil in
          a proper way before starting the cultivation practice. The soil
          preparation methods are given below.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Ploughing <br />
          Ploughing or tilling is the process of loosening and turning the soil
          up and down to facilitate the availability of nutrients in the root
          zone of the cultivating crop.

        <p>
          The following are the few important agricultural implements generally
          used in the field preparation.
        </p>

        />
        <br /> <br />
        <p>
          Plough <br />
          Plough is mainly used for tilling the soil, to add fertilisers to the
          crop, remove weeds and other waste materials from the field and also
          to turn the soil. A plough is made of wood and is drawn by a pair of
          bulls or horses. It contains a strong and a sharp triangular iron
          strip known as ploughshare. The main part of the plough is a long log
          of wood which is called plough shaft. The other end is attached to a
          beam which is placed on the bullâ€™s neck. Hoe <br />
          It is a simple tool which is used to till the land, remove weeds and
          dig up soil. It has a long wooden rod with a bent iron plate at one
          end. The other end may be attached to an animal. <br />
          <br /> Cultivator <br />
          Cultivators are driven by tractor. Cultivators also kill weeds and dig
          up unwanted vegetation available in the field. Nowadays ploughing is
          done by tractor-driven cultivator. The use of cultivator saves labour
          and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          b. Leveling <br />
          Once the field is ploughed, the topsoil is quite loose. The levelling
          of soil is done with an implement called the leveller, which is a
          heavy wooden or iron plank. Levelling of the field also helps in
          uniform distribution of water during irrigation. <br />
          <br />
          c. Basal Manuring <br />
          Manuring means adding manure to the soil. Manure contains many
          nutrients required for the growth of crop plants. To increase the
          fertility of the soil, we add manure to the soil even before sowing
          because it gets properly incorporated into the soil. Application of
          green manure and farmyard manure will always enhance the growth and
          yield of the crops.

      <Collapsible trigger="Sowing of seeds">
        <p>
          This is the second step in crop production. Once the soil preparation
          is over, sowing of the seeds can be done. Sowing is the actual process
          of planting the seeds in the soil. The seeds that are sown have to be
          selected very carefully to have high quality. Various methods are
          followed for sowing the seeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Sowing by hand <br />
          The scattering of seeds by hand is the simplest method of sowing
          seeds. This is the most economical method of sowing seed.

        />
        <p>
          b. Seed Drill <br />
          Seed drill is a modern method of sowing seeds. It is a better and more
          efficient method than sowing by hand. It is usually done by attaching
          iron drills to a tractor. Seed drills ensure that the seeds are
          planted at equal intervals and at the correct depth in the soil.

        />
        <p>
          c. Dibbling <br />
          It is the placement of seed material in a furrow, pit or hole at
          predetermined spacing with a dibble, more commonly by hand. Soil
          around the hole is pressed with hand or leg for moist soil contact.
